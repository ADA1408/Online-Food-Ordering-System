    "text": "Hello and welcome to your fall life. I would like to campaign for you to enter into fall soup season with this cozy classic Broccoli Cheese Soup. It is a hug-in-a-bowl that is not only *easy to make* but honestly puts Panera’s version to shame. Ooooh yes, I said it! Listen, I truly love Panera, but side-by-side with this comforting pot of creaminess gently bubbling away on the stove, with the FRESH broccoli and carrots, and the glorious cheddar cheese that you ate straight off the cutting board shredded by hand, there is no comparing. Broccoli cheese soup, in case you needed reminding, is going to bring several good things into your life: a delicate start of butter and garlic and onions, a silky-smooth soup base, little bite-sized bits of just-right broccoli, thinly sliced carrots, and a sharp, creamy finish from that cheddar cheese. It’s flavorful, it’s veg-loaded and fresh, but it’s also extremely comforting, unassuming, and mellow. And I think we could all use a little more mellow right about now, yes? There’s salt, there’s pepper, and there’s paprika to season, but hello VERY IMPORTANT there’s also hot crusty bread for dipping. "

    "text": "Paneer-based north Indian curries have always been one of the popular curry choices for most of us. Typically it was introduced as a meat-based alternative for vegetarians but has garnered a lot of attention towards it. There are myriad ways of preparing gravy-based paneer curries and one such hugely popular north Indian curry recipe is the Matar paneer recipe known for subtle creaminess and flavor."

    "title": "Tandoori Chicken",
    "text": "Crisp on the outside, soft and succulent on the inside, Tandoori Chicken is the mainstay of Punjabi cooking, with its roots firmly in the Mughal era. This dish gets its name from the tandoor, a charcoal oven with clay walls that cooks flatbreads, skewered ingredients and portions of meat with precision and flavour. In my home, no summer is complete without mounds of these being served up, with the prerequisite sliced raw onion rings and lemon wedges. In the wettest of British summers, simply keep the oven handy and remember to factor in plenty of time for marinating and preparation. I’ve served mine here with a raw chard and onion salad softened first with a lime and coriander dressing. You can try this the traditional way too, opting for warm naan and an ice cold cucumber and mint raita. "

    "text": "Khumb, or mushrooms, are the perfectly delicate ingredient to match a pot of spicy tomato curry in this Mushroom Potato Masala. While mushrooms are not typically Indian, they are enjoyed in sauteed vegetable and curries around the country. Paired with potatoes, it makes for a weekday friendly one-pot meal. I like to bake this dish as it frees me up to get on with other chores. Just make sure you start with an oven safe saute pan or shallow casserole pot so you can sizzling the spices on the cooker and then stick the lot in the oven to finish. I made some home made naan to mop up the thick curry, but you could just as easily reach for the ready stuff.  "

The aromatic spices give it a wonderful flavor, and the prawns are cooked to perfection in the delicious sauce.
